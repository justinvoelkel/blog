title: Being a Dad and a Developer

description: It's probably better to read that as being a parent first and foremost as well as a developer. Without a doubt having kids is one of the best things that's ever happened to me. But, how do you balance the responsibilities of being a parent and trying to stay up to date in an industry constantly trying to leave you behind?

This is something I've wanted to write about for a long time. Let me say this right away - I _love_ being a Dad. As of this writing I am the father of two amazing, beautify, and crazy little girls. I wouldn't have things any other way. That being said, being a parent in this profession presents a lot of challenge. I've always operated with the mindset that if you aren't learning and moving forward then you are actively moving in reverse. There doesn't seem to be a skill stasis in the software industry - it evolves quickly and if you aren't playing along your skills can go stale very quickly. Being a parent is giant responsibility and being present for my family is my first priority _always_. So, how do you keep up while your disposable free time continues to shrink?

## Prioritize, Prioritize, Prioritize

In a prior life where I didn't have kids and I had a bunch of disposable time I did _a lot_ of playing around with a variety of different technologies, frameworks, languages, etc. Now, with a very limited time budget, I still have that desire (and sometimes a healthy does of anxiety/FOMO to go with it) but the time committment is too much and unrealistic. Instead of trying to cover a broad width of topics I've recently forced myself to sit down and _really_ think about what topics excite me and make me curious about development. Once I had a list of things I was truly excited and curious about it helped me narrow the scope of courses, articles, and documentation I was willing to look at.

That is not to say you should ignore everything else entirely. It's important to generally keep in touch with what is going on around the industry. Even if you're not going to drill down on a subject just having some knowledge of what's out there and what's new is very important.

## Get Creative with Your Time

That's a lot easier said than done. But, what I mean when I say that is - find creative ways to utilize your existing time to learn. For me that means listening to podcasts or books while I am doing other activities - walking, driving, cutting grass, showering etc. I'm sure lots of people do this already but it becomes essential when your free time is limited. Also, to go along with being creative with your time, be realistic about what you want to achieve in the time you have. I really struggle with this at times because I'm human and I'm impatient. For me I've figured out that the momentum of picking things up here and there - even in small bursts - is _more_ important than fully grasping something right away in one extended sitting. The smaller iterative approach can actually be a silver lining if you are the type of person (like myself) that tends to ramp up quickly and burn out just as fast. Slow, stead, and sure wins this race.
