description: It's probably better to read that as being a parent first and foremost as well as a developer. Without a doubt having kids is one of the best things that's ever happened to me. But, how do you balance the responsibilities of being a parent and trying to stay up to date in an industry constantly trying to leave you behind?

This is something I've wanted to write about for a long time. Let me say this right away - I _love_ being a Dad. As of this writing I am the father of two amazing, beautify, and crazy little girls. I wouldn't have things any other way. That being said, being a parent in this profession presents a lot of challenge. I've always operated with the mindset that if you aren't learning and moving forward then you are actively moving in reverse. There doesn't seem to be a skill stasis in the software industry - it evolves quickly and if you aren't playing along your skills can go stale very quickly. Being a parent is giant responsibility and being present for my family is my first priority _always_. So, how do you keep up while your disposable free time continues to shrink?

## Prioritize, Prioritize, Prioritize

In a prior life where I didn't have kids and I had a bunch of disposable time I did _a lot_ of playing around with a variety of different technologies, frameworks, languages, etc. Now, with a very limited time budget, I still have that desire (and sometimes a healthy does of anxiety/FOMO to go with it) but the time committment is too much and unrealistic. Instead of trying to cover a broad width of topics I've recently forced myself to sit down and _really_ think about what topics excite me and make me curious about development.
